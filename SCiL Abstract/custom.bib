  abstract = 	 {The tier-based strictly local ($\TSL{}$) languages are a class of formal languages that, alongside the strictly piecewise class, effectively model some long-distance generalizations in natural language (Heinz et al., 2011). Two learning algorithms for $\TSL{}$ already exist: one by Jardine and Heinz (2016) and one by Jardine and McMullin (2017). The former is limited in that it cannot learn all $\TSL{}$ patterns. The latter is restricted to a batch-learning environment. We present a general algorithm without these limitations. In particular we show that $\TSL{}$ is efficiently learnable online via reinterpretation of a strictly local grammar, and this mechanism generalizes to the strictly piecewise class as well. However we note that the known $\TSL{}$ learning algorithms are not robust in the face of interaction with other constraints, posing a challenge for the utility of this class for phonotactics.}
